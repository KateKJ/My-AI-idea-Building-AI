# Project Title

Sobriety Insight Project (SIP)

## Summary

Building AI course project
The Sobriety Insight Project (SIP) utilizes smartwatch data and machine learning to detect and address problematic alcohol use. By analyzing biometric data (e.g., heart rate, sleep quality, activity levels) and combining it with user feedback, SIP provides personalized insights and actionable interventions to promote healthier behavior.

## Background

Alcohol misuse is a widespread issue, particularly in societies where consumption is socially acceptable and deeply ingrained in daily life. Individuals often overlook the early signs of problematic drinking, leading to delayed interventions that exacerbate physical, mental, and social harm.
The Czech Republic ranks among the top countries globally for alcohol consumption, making it a critical health and societal issue. This trend underscores the urgent need for tools that help individuals recognize and manage their consumption habits effectively.
Growing up in the Czech Republic, I witnessed the normalization of alcohol consumption and its impact on individuals and communities. This firsthand experience, combined with my current studies in Addictology as a medical student, has fueled my passion for creating innovative tools to address alcohol misuse. With over a decade of experience in market research, sociology, and customer behavior analysis, I aim to apply these skills to a solution that merges cutting-edge technology with behavioral insights
This project represents the intersection of health care, technology, and behavioral science. By making early detection accessible through wearable devices, it has the potential to empower individuals to take charge of their health and reduce the societal burden of alcohol-related issues.


## How is it used?

The project is intended for individuals concerned about their alcohol consumption or those seeking to improve their overall health. The app would integrate seamlessly with existing smartwatch platforms like Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Garmin.
Who are the people affected by it?
* Primary Users: Individuals who want to monitor their health and prevent problematic alcohol use.
* Secondary Beneficiaries: Healthcare providers, addiction counselors, and families, who could use the insights for intervention and support.


## Data sources and AI methods
What data sources does your project depend on?
* Wearable Device Data: Metrics like heart rate variability, sleep quality, activity levels, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature.
* Self-Reported Feedback: User-provided data through mood-tracking tools and questionnaires.
* Contextual Inputs: User-logged stressors and social events that may trigger alcohol consumption.
Which AI techniques do you think will be helpful?
* Machine Learning Models: To identify behavioral patterns and predict risky alcohol use.
* Classification and Regression Analysis: For detecting changes in health metrics that correlate with alcohol misuse.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP): To analyze self-reported feedback and identify emotional or situational triggers.
Demo Potential: A working prototype could integrate smartwatch data with AI algorithms to provide users with real-time alerts and tailored recommendations.


## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
* Formal Diagnosis: SIP does not replace professional diagnosis or treatment for alcohol use disorders.
* Incomplete Data: The effectiveness of the app depends on consistent user engagement and wearable device accuracy.
* Ethical and Privacy Concerns: Handling sensitive health data requires stringent safeguards, which could limit some functionalities


## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 
* Advanced AI Features: Incorporating adaptive learning algorithms to refine insights based on individual behavior.
* Healthcare Integration: Partnering with clinics and addiction treatment centers for a more comprehensive approach.
* Cultural Customization: Tailoring interventions for diverse populations, considering regional attitudes toward alcohol.

I am here with an innovative idea, but I want to be transparent about my technical expertise: while I have completed two basic courses on AI, I am not a programmer and lack the technical skills required to develop this project independently. I would need significant support, especially in areas like data integration, machine learning model development, and app implementation. Collaboration with skilled developers and AI experts would be essential to bring this vision to life.

## Acknowledgments

The Sobriety Insight Project builds on advances in wearable technology, open-source AI frameworks, and addiction research. It draws inspiration from my academic studies, personal experiences in a high-consumption culture, and over a decade of experience in understanding human behavior through market research and sociology.
